# CMS-BlogSite
A site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. 

# Motivation for this project

Learn to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. Have the app follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

# Reason for this project 

Build a site from scratch that is similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well and deploy it to Heroku.

# What I learned from this project 

In this activity I learnt:

* The step by step breaking down method of the acceptance criteria on HW assignment and the importance of commenting especially after the code has been erased and you cannot remember what was on the code line previously.

* The importance of stackoverflow when trying to figure out what the inspect mistake made means/wants you to correct what you need fixed. 

* How to render dynamic HTML using a template engine, like Handlebars.js.. 

* How to configure Heroku for deployment of an application using MySQL.
